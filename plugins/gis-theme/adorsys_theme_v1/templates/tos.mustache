        <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">1. Moodle and Third Party Content</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
            When using the Site, you may be able to access or download certain Content provided by Moodle ("Moodle Content"),
            or Content provided by third parties ("Third Party Content"). Content is governed by the licence that accompanies it.
            By using or downloading any Content, you agree to the applicable licence. It is your responsibility to ensure you
            have proper permission for your use of any Content. If you are unclear as to what licence applies to any Content,
            it is recommended that you ask the author.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            The Site, including the design, layout, look and feel, and Moodle Content, is copyrighted by Moodle and its licensors.
            To the extent the Site, portions of the Site, or Moodle Content does not designate a licence, Moodle hereby grants you
            a copyright licence to copy such material for your own personal or internal business purposes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">2. Your Content</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
            Where applicable, you may be able to upload or otherwise provide certain Content, such as software (source code,
            binary code, configuration files, etc.), documents, images, videos, or other material to the Site via your Account
            ("Your Content"). Except if specifically stated otherwise, Your Content is not confidential and may be made publicly
            available. You are responsible for keeping your own backups of Your Content. You represent that you have the right
            to provide Your Content to Moodle and its users.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            It's your responsibility to make clear the licence under which you are providing Your Content. You retain ownership
            of Your Content. By posting Your Content to the Site, you hereby grant to Moodle a non-exclusive, irrevocable,
            worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, reproduce, distribute, sublicence, adapt, modify, and publish Your Content,
            provided this licence to Moodle does not supersede the terms of any open source licence you may explicitly apply
            to Your Content.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">3. Account</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
            Where applicable, you may register for an account on the Site (an "Account"). You must provide current, complete,
            and accurate information as required by the applicable account registration form. You or each of your authorised
            personnel must be over the appropriate legal age to create an Account on the Site and you as Registered User warrant
            that this requirement is met. Should Moodle be advised otherwise, it reserves the right at its sole discretion
            to cancel/remove your Account immediately.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            Each Account may only be accessed and used by each Registered User. In the case of employers, companies, institutions,
            organisations or similar, the term Registered User shall include their authorised personnel. Any activity completed
            through an Account will be deemed to have been undertaken by the Registered User. Where applicable, you may choose
            to create an Account by authenticating via an existing account you have with a third party, in which case the third
            party terms may also apply to such action.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            You are responsible for the security of your Account and you agree not to share your password or access to the Site
            with another person. Moodle is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your Account secure.
            You will notify Moodle immediately if your Account information is lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised. Moodle may
            suspend or deactivate your Account if Moodle determines that this step is needed (such as if your Account has been
            compromised or you have violated these terms).
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            You cannot have 'Moodle' in your Account name, as this may cause confusion that you are associated with or endorsed
            by Moodle.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">4. Your Use of the Site</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
            You will not use the Site in a way that violates any laws or these terms, infringes anyone's rights (including but not
            limited to intellectual property rights), is offensive, or interferes with the Site or its features. You will follow
            the Code of Conduct.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">For example, you will not use the Site or provide Content that:</p>

        </ul>

        <p class="mb-6">

            commercial solicitations in compliance with our Advertising Guidelines located in section 5 or as explicitly
            permitted by Moodle.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
            If Moodle determines that you have acted illegally, in violation of these terms, or inappropriately, Moodle may
            terminate your Account, remove Your Content, prohibit you from using the Site, take appropriate legal actions, or
            take other action as Moodle deems appropriate. Moodle has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the use of
            the Site, any Content, and any activity on the Site.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">5. Advertising Guidelines</h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Advertising commercial products and services</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
            Advertising commercial products and services using Moodle’s branding or even the word “Moodle” needs careful consideration to ensure that the whole community has an equal and equitable playing field. We need to balance the support for those who financially support the Moodle Project and protect consumers from misleading conduct and confusion. Therefore, while we encourage self-disclosure of your commercial endeavours within your profile (it provides context to the discussions) we seek to restrict overuse when promoting commercial Moodle™ branded services. In short, fair use description is fine.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Unsolicited advertisements / spam will be deleted</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
            Posting unsolicited and blatant advertisements or within forum discussions for products and services with no appropriate context are subject to deletion. Such blog entries, forum discussions, docs or other unwanted content is unacceptable use and Moodle reserves the right to take action in accordance with Section 4 (including termination of your access to the Site).
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Official advertising that supports the Moodle Project</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
            Moodle permits various types of official advertising to take place on Moodle community sites and particularly, Moodle Certified Partners and Service Providers, and Certified Integration Partners all receive certain marketing privileges, including targeted advertisement to users in the relevant Partner country locations. This privilege is afforded to Moodle Partners and Certified Integration Partners who pay royalties to participate in Moodle Partner Programs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">6. Feedback &amp; Security Reporting</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">
            You may provide ideas, suggestions, proposals, or other feedback to Moodle via the Site ("Feedback"). Moodle may use such Feedback for any purpose, including incorporating the Feedback into or using the Feedback to develop and improve Moodle products and other Moodle offerings without attribution or compensation to you. You grant Moodle a perpetual and irrevocable licence to use all Feedback for any purpose. You agree to provide Feedback to Moodle only in compliance with applicable laws. You represent that you have the authority to provide the Feedback and that Feedback will not include confidential information.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">

        <p class="mb-6">
